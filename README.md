# -Plant-Species-for-Classification-Task


## Problem Statement
In this project, we aim to classify plant species based on images. The dataset consists of 4,570 image files belonging to 12 different plant species. The task is to predict the plant species for images in the test set and generate a CSV file with the predictions.

## Explanation
We will employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful class of deep learning models widely used for image classification tasks. CNNs are adept at capturing spatial hierarchies of features in images, making them well-suited for our task of plant species classification.

### Dataset
- **Training Set**: The training set contains images of plant species categorized into different folders.
- **Test Set**: The test set comprises images for which predictions need to be made.
- **Sample Submission**: A sample submission file is provided in the correct format for reference.

## Evaluation
We will evaluate the performance of our CNN model using the F1-score metric with the 'macro' average parameter. F1-score provides a balanced measure of a model's precision and recall across all classes.
